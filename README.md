# Computational Physics Projects: Numerical Techniques in Physics

Welcome to my repository for the **Numerical Techniques in Physics** project under the guidance of **Apurv Keer**, a fourth-year student in the Department of Physics at IIT Bombay. This repository contains solutions and analysis for weekly assignments provided as part of the project, using **C++** as the primary programming language.

## 📜 Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing numerical methods to solve physics problems. It provides hands-on experience with coding numerical algorithms, plotting results, and analyzing outcomes. Over the course of four weeks, I will work on various tasks and document the results here.

Each week's work is organized into its respective folder, with solutions to assigned problems, and relevant plots.
