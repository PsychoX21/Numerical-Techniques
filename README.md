# Computational Physics Projects: Numerical Techniques in Physics

Welcome to my repository for the **Numerical Techniques in Physics** project under the guidance of **Apurv Keer**, a fourth-year student in the Department of Physics at IIT Bombay. This repository contains solutions and analysis for weekly assignments provided as part of the project, using **C++** as the primary programming language.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing numerical methods to solve physics problems. It provides hands-on experience with coding numerical algorithms, plotting results, and analyzing outcomes. Over the course of four weeks, I will work on various tasks and document the results here.

Each week's work is organized into its respective folder, with solutions to assigned problems, and relevant plots.

## ðŸ“š Weekly Assignments

### Week 1: Foundations of Numerical Techniques

* Setup: Configured C++ environment with VS Code and GNUplot.
* Newton-Raphson Method: Found roots of a polynomial equation.
* Secant Method: Determined roots for a non-linear equation using iterative approximation.
* Euler's Method: Solved a first-order ODE with different step sizes, comparing results to the exact solution.
* RK4 Method: Implemented the Runge-Kutta 4th order method and compared accuracy to Eulerâ€™s method.
* Solving Linear Systems: Used Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods to solve a set of linear equations iteratively.

### Week 2: Second Order ODEs with some applications

* Solving second-order ODEs with Euler and RK4.
* Van der Pol Oscillator: Simulated and analyzed the oscillatorâ€™s behavior for varying parameters.
* Lorenz Attractor: Explored chaotic dynamics and sensitivity to initial conditions.
